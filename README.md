The Todo list project is a simple web application that allows users to create and manage a list of tasks or todos. The project is implemented using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, without the use of any external libraries or frameworks. It provides a minimalistic design that can be customized according to personal preferences.

The main features of the Todo list include:

Adding Tasks: Users can enter a task in the provided text box and click the "Add" button or press Enter to add the task to the list.

Deleting Tasks: Each task in the list is accompanied by a delete button. Clicking this button removes the corresponding task from the list entirely.

Checking off Tasks: Each task has a checkbox associated with it. Users can mark a task as completed by checking the checkbox. The completed task remains in the list but is visually differentiated from the rest of the tasks.

Total Task Count: The project displays the total number of tasks in the list, providing users with an overview of the tasks they have added.

The Todo list project emphasizes simplicity and usability while adhering to the vanilla JavaScript approach. It encourages creativity in terms of styling and offers room for enhancements, such as user accessibility improvements and animations.

By building this project, developers can gain a better understanding of fundamental JavaScript concepts, DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic HTML and CSS styling. It serves as a foundation for more complex todo list applications and provides a starting point for learning and exploring additional JavaScript frameworks or libraries.
